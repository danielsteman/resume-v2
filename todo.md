### CMS ###
Use markdown files as lightweigth CMS. Create an API that parses markdown files and returns json to the frontend. This way, content can be loaded dynamically when demanded by the client and doesn't load as a bulk. The data objects are divided by section of the web page:
- About
- Experience
- Projects
